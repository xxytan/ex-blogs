## My Holiday Plan
- Soon the winter holiday comes, how excited am I! To make my holiday more wonderful, I listed some plans. Let's have a change.
- Rest is the first. When we were at school, study pressure makes me suffocating. "Holiday doesn't come easily", I can release myself eventually! So I'm going to hang out with my friends, have some barbecues, and play video games. Also, homework is necessary. Something we learnt before we're going to forget if we only play in the whole holiday. In order to avoid this situation happen, i'll also finish my homework and review what I learnt in class. Last but not least: do chores. My parent's won't get more spare time, although the holiday comes. So i'll do chores like sweeping the floor, do the laundry, do the dishes, and so on. I don't want to see them doing chores with a tired body
- In a word, "Holiday can't cause life to stop". I'll try to balance these things. I can't wait for the holiday!
