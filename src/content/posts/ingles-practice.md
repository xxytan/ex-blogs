# My Holiday Plans
&emsp;&emsp;How time flies! The winter holiday is getting closer and closer. To make my holiday more wonderful, I listed some plans.
&emsp;&emsp;Rest is the first. When I was at school, all day's buzy study were always suffocating. I can release myself eventually! So I'm going to hang out with my friends, have some barbecues, and play video games. Also, homework is necessary. Something I learnt in class I'll forget if I do only play during the whole holiday. In order to avoid this situation, I'll also finish my homework meanwhile I enjoy myself and review often. Last but not least: do chores. My parent's won't stop working, although the holiday comes. So i will try to do chores that I have ablility to do, such as sweeping and washing. I don't want to see them doing chores with a tired body.
&emsp;&emsp;In a word, "Holiday can't cause life to stop". I'll balance my things. I'm looking forward to the coming winter holiday!
